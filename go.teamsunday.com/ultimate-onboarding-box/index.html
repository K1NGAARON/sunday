                The Ultimate Onboarding Box To Welcome New Employees
            </h1>
            <p>
                If your organization is looking to hire new employees, it's critical that they have a great first day. Onboarding boxes are the ideal way to establish essential cultural principles in your organization, and it can help you supercharge your cultural momentum by delivering shareable moments.

            You never get a second chance to make a first Impression. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again. On average 28% of new hires leave within their first 90 days. Replacing that employee can cost up to 200% of their annual salary, a tremendous cost for every company. One of the key reasons mentioned is the feeling of being disconnected from the company & colleagues and feeling like an outsider.
            <br><br>
            This is exactly what makes an employee onboarding process such a crucial point for a successful business. Imagine having to spend thousands of dollars per year because your employees are leaving all the time. This would make it incredibly difficult to grow your business. 
            <br><br>
            Every phase of onboarding is an opportunity to nail your company's first impression  and strengthen the bond with new hires. A solid process not only bridges the gap between candidate and employee experience, it’s a stimulant for employee satisfaction and retention. Of course, it's more difficult to make a powerful first impression with limited resources, budget and leadership support. 
            <br><br>
            To help you succeed, we've put together this guide to upgrade your onboarding process with employee onboarding boxes. From inspiring examples to practical guides, Sunday will help to boost the feeling of inclusion and make the new hires immediately part of the team. 
            <br><br>
            Here’s onboarding in a box: the ultimate guide!

            First things first?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Pre-Boarding! The onboarding of your new hire starts the moment they sign the contract. So pre-boarding is the period of time between an employee accepting their job offer and their first day. Essentially, it is the very first step of the overall onboarding process. And yet a step that is overlooked by so many HR-managers and business owners. 
            <br><br>
            Pre-boarding should reassure your new employee that though they may have been swimming in a sea of choice, choosing your company was the right one. Start communicating how excited you are for them to join, prepare them for success on day one and share your corporate culture from step one.
            <br><br>
            By employing preboarding into your recruitment and onboarding strategy, you help keep up the momentum and excitement established in the hiring process. Not only does it increase new hires’ excitement, but it also fosters a relationship with them before orientation. So before your new employees step foot into your office, do your homework with the following checklist. This list will help you identify every way to make them feel valued and welcome.

            What’s an onboarding box?
        </h2>
        <p>
            When a new employee joins your firm, you want to make a lasting impression on them with a gift that embodies your organization's culture and values. Onboarding boxes are a creative approach to make new employees feel special. During the pandemic onboarding boxes were the only personal touchpoint they had with the company they were about to start working for. The onboarding box is set to become a feature of many forward-thinking HR departments as individuals return to work in the office.
            <br><br>
            Onboarding boxes are usually filled with a range of branded items like apparel, pens, notebooks and water bottles. The kit you create should convey the culture of your organization and instill a sense of pride and loyalty among incoming employees. Since they are built to transform new hires into real brand ambassadors, the company also benefits from employees who become more quickly productive team players. Because you make them feel at ease in their workplace, a part of the team, and confident in their ability to accomplish their duties from day one.

        <h2>
            What should be included in an onboarding box?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The ideal onboarding box is different for every company. Depending on your DNA, the best welcome pack for new employees is customized to represent the company core values, inspiring the new employee in their first week. Not only the items in the box should be an extension of your brand identity, also the box itself can be fully personalized. This way, a total experience is created, one that your stakeholders will certainly not miss out on.
            <br><br>
            The items that should be in the box are a mix of products that a new employee could make use of at work, along with objects that are slightly more personal and could be used by someone outside of their workplace. Think about office supplies, hoodies, coffee mugs, notepads, tote bags, towels, and even sportswear.
            <br><br>
            In order for company fashion to be worn outside and therefore increase the brand’s visibility, companies should keep in mind that such garments must be tasteful and of high quality. Your unique culture translated in fashion is the ultimate way to activate your brand ambassadors. Add the clever copywriting and eye catching design, and this is an onboarding box that really makes the recipient feel welcome.
            <br><br>
            We can help you put together the <a href="https://teamsunday.com/en/solutions/hr/employee-onboarding/">perfect box</a>, fully personalized in your brand identity.

                <span class="bold">Sense of Belonging -</span> Most organizations seek to establish a strong company culture, and being welcomed with branded apparel is a great way to develop a feeling of unity from the start. The fact that onboarding boxes are frequently shared demonstrates a true sense of belonging.

            Box power! 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Word of mouth is the most powerful marketing tool for a company. Transforming your employees into real brand ambassadors that spread the word should be the number one focus of smart brands. Marketing is about more than just selling a product. It's all about establishing a brand, being an industry authority, and so on.
            <br><br>
            A firm can also play the role of storyteller. It's more than a social media post; such posts serve as excellent marketing for the firm that provided the kit. The onboarding box is the ideal material for creating a compelling story.
            <br><br>
            Not only is it thrilling for the company to hire new individuals, but it is also exciting for the employees. Everyone who follows their favorite brand on social media wants to learn more about it. Here are some suggestions for what you might include in your welcome packages. Have a look and try to get as many creative ideas as possible.

        <p>
            A great onboarding package can tackle all these worries and create the perfect start for a solid onboarding process. As Deliverect is ambitious and innovative, they hire 10 new employees every week and so 10 new possible ambassadors. The Belgian company is a fast booming business, so building ambassadorship is a priority in their revenue generation plan.
            <br><br>
            And to make an onboarding process successful, it has to be uniform for everyone in the company. That’s why we created personalized boxes again, but now focussed on their onboarding process for their 11 different offices. The personalized box was filled with a hoodie, a T-shirt, socks and a thermos flask. This time, they wanted to reduce the use of plastic, so they chose a bottle made of metal instead of the dopper bottle made of plastic in the first box. Because it needed to be sent around the globe, they used the Sunday Wardrobe™ to warehouse, handle and ship their onboarding boxes hasslefree.

            When do you give an onboarding box?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Pre-boarding and onboarding are only the first steps in an employee's continuing education. You'll need an onboarding solution to perform a successful onboarding that saves you and your HR team admin time and repetitive work. Make sure that some of the important features contain automations that allow you to automate a large portion of the onboarding process. 
            <br><br>
            For example, sending an onboarding box to your new hire in just a few clicks:
            <br><br>
            Your welcome gift should be one of the first things a new employee receives in pre-boarding, whether you work in the office or remotely. There are a number of ways to give a welcome present to an employee, depending on your onboarding timetable and location.
            <br><br>
            Traditionally, the employee's welcome package will be ready for them on their desk on their first day. However, some businesses will send their welcome packages to employees a week or two ahead of time. This provides them a good start in learning about the organization and settling into their new position. Send the welcome package to the new employee to open in their home office if your team is remote-first. If you're mailing the welcome package, make sure it arrives well before their first day so they get that "Christmas morning" feeling.

            Zero hassle. Zero mistakes. Zero stress. How?
        </h2>
        <p>
            To create that “Christmas morning" feeling, you need to get the right item to the right person at the right moment. So you might need an all-in-one platform making it super easy to warehouse, handle and ship your onboarding boxes.
            <br><br>
            With more and more companies working internationally or remote, the logistics of these boxes can be a real struggle. Employees seek a personalized and seamless onboarding experience that is free from endless paperwork, the logistical struggles and manual effort.  
            <br><br>
            Businesses must develop a dynamic onboarding process that keeps employees interested and pleased from the moment they sign the contract until their first day on the job. To make a positive first impression and reap the rewards, businesses must move away from purely manual operations and instead employ a solution that effectively automates several phases of the onboarding process.
            <br><br>
            Our platform, the <a href="https://teamsunday.com/en/platform/" target="_blank">Sunday Wardrobe™</a> was especially built to help companies manage and ship their personalized boxes globally. With the click of a button we ship your onboarding box anywhere in the world.

            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            In this guide we've talked about how important the whole onboarding process is to inspire employees to be as productive as they can be and how onboarding boxes can be a great supporting tool. We gave numerous employee welcome kit ideas and a list of branded items that your new hires will be thrilled to find inside their welcome packages both because they’re useful as well as of high quality. 
            <br><br>
            We’ve talked you through the timeline of your onboarding process, where the best opportunity lies to embed key cultural values into your business. By delivering shareable moments, new hires can share them on LinkedIn or other social media platforms, resulting in a unified brand experience for new employees as well as increased brand exposure for the company.
            <br><br>
            You're now ready to construct a welcome package with a compelling and intelligent onboarding experience that leaves a lasting first impression. When you adapt and use the tools in this guide, you'll be able to capture and engage eager new employees from the start, resulting in talent retention. Remember that not everything is one-size-fits-all, so customize and experiment to find out what works best for your company and culture.
            <br><br>
            Are you looking to upgrade your onboarding experience today?
