We hereby undertake to always comply with the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and other applicable regulations.

            Sunday is a company incorporated under Belgian law. As a company we specialize in the offer and supply of qualitative and personalized merchandise, and the provision of related services such as consulting and product development. This Privacy Statement therefore applies to the personal data that we process from you in this regard as a data controller.

        <h2>
            2. What does "process personal data" mean?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Processing of personal data (hereinafter "data") includes any processing of data that can identify you as a natural person. This can include, for example, your contact details or order history. You can read more about which data exactly this involves in this Privacy Statement. The term "processing" is very broad and covers, among other things, the collection, storage, use of your data, or the sharing thereof with third parties. Sunday processes your personal data only in the context of its commercial activities as an enterprise.
        </p>

        <h2>
            3. To whom and when does this Privacy Statement apply?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Statement applies where Sunday is responsible for processing your data. This means that Sunday determines for what purposes (why) and by what means (how) your data is processed. However, when our customer decides on these factors, this Privacy Statement does not apply. At Sunday, in the course of our activities, we sometimes act as a data controller, and sometimes as a processor of our customer. Therefore, we briefly clarify below when, specifically, this Privacy Statement applies.
            <br><br>
            Sunday as a data controller: does apply
            With respect to the data of the persons listed below, Sunday acts as a data controller. This includes persons who belonged to these categories in the past (e.g. former customer), or persons who may belong to these categories in the future (e.g. potential customer).
            <br><br>
            Our customers, to whom we deliver our merchandise and provide our services;
            Our business partners, who assist us in operating our business;
            prospective employees, who submit an application to us;
            other persons who would contact us, e.g. after visiting our website www.teamsunday.com, as long as we do not act as a mere processor with respect to your data.
            If any of the persons referred to above is a legal entity, we still process data of our contacts at these entities and the GDPR continues to apply.
            <br><br>
            Sunday as processor: not applicable
            In specific circumstances, we act as our customer's processor. In fact, customers often engage us to produce merchandise and then deliver it directly to its employees, customers and business partners. In order to fulfill such orders, the customer will provide us with some data about you, such as your name, address details, and the correct size and any personalized features of the merchandise intended for you. In this case, we will process your data purely as a processor of our customer and in doing so we must at all times comply with our customer's instructions. After successful delivery of the order, we are contractually obligated to delete your data after a limited period of time. Since the customer bears ultimate responsibility for this processing, we refer you to our customer for any questions you may have in this regard regarding the way your data is processed. This situation will be relevant to you if you are an employee, customer or business partner of one of our customers and, on behalf of this customer, receive merchandise that has been produced by us.
        </p>

        <h2>
            4. What data do we process?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Below we clarify what data we may process from you. Depending on the specific situation, your preferences and the way in which you contact us, we may not process all of the data below. For the sake of clarity, we will first explain below what data we generally process about all our contacts. Then we will explain which data we additionally process for specific categories of contacts, namely our customers and business partners and our candidate employees.

        <p>
            We will not retain your data longer than necessary for the purpose for which the data was collected and is processed, as specified above.
            <br><br>
            With respect to our customers, this primarily concerns the offering and delivery of our merchandise and the provision of our related services (whether or not after delivery). With respect to our business partners, this concerns managing our cooperation.
            <br><br>
            In this regard, we will keep your data after your last order or after the termination of the cooperation for a reasonable period of time in order to safeguard our evidence in case of a dispute, or in response to potential defects related to the merchandise in light of our liability for defective delivery, non-delivery or late delivery.
            <br><br>
            For your data that may appear in our accounting records from you, as our customer or business partner, to a limited extent, they are kept for 7 years within the framework of our legal obligations in this regard.
            <br><br>
            With regard to the data we hold on you as a candidate employee, we undertake to delete your data within a reasonable period of time if it does not initially lead to a cooperation proposal. However, if in this case you give your specific consent for us to keep your data so that we can contact you again later, we will keep your data for a maximum of 2 years.
        </p>

        <h2>
            8. Where do we keep your data and how is it protected?
        </h2>
        <p>
            For the digital preservation of your data, we mainly rely on external specialized service providers who store it in the cloud. However, our websites are hosted in-house through our servers located in Belgium.
            <br><br>
            We outsource much of our processing in the context of our business as a company to third parties, as clarified under Title 5. Any external service providers act as data processors on our behalf, where appropriate.
            <br><br>
            We and our processors have taken the necessary physical and appropriate technical and organizational (precautionary) measures to secure your data against loss or any form of unlawful processing. We only grant access to the data to our own employees and third parties if they need access for legitimate, relevant business purposes.
            <br><br>
            Your data is hereby stored as much as possible within the European Economic Area. Our own servers and those of our cloud service providers are therefore located in Belgium. However, it is possible that your data may be processed outside the EEA in connection with the use of specific functions on our website. This will only be done to countries where the European Commission has confirmed that they guarantee an adequate level of protection for your data, or where other measures have been taken to ensure the lawful processing of your data in these third countries

        <p>
            We mainly obtain your data directly from you, as a result of the contact we have with each other with a view to the (possible) delivery of our merchandise or the provision of our services, or with a view to a (possible) cooperation. However, we cannot rule out obtaining certain of your data indirectly in specific circumstances, from public sources or from third parties.
            <br><br>
            When we obtain your data from public sources, this involves, for example, consulting the Crossroads Bank of Enterprises (CBE), in order to verify your order or proposal for cooperation on behalf of a company. It is also possible that we obtain your data through your company, if the company in which you work is our customer or business partner and we need your data in this context (e.g. for the purpose of discussing potential merchandise designs with you as marketing manager, or for the purpose of submitting the terms of our cooperation to you as legal manager, or for invoicing purposes if you take care of the accounting at the customer or business partner).
            <br><br>
            In addition, we may receive your data from our customers because they wish to deliver merchandise to you as their employee, customer or business partner. As explained above under Section 2, in this case we are merely acting as a processor of your data and you should contact our customer who commissioned the production of this merchandise and the delivery thereof to your address for further clarification. Should we nevertheless receive questions or requests from you in this regard, we will pass them on to the relevant customer.
            <br><br>
            For prospective employees, we may consult your profile on professional social media channels or receive your data from an interim or recruitment company when you apply to us in this way.
