    <li>Silverfin’s extra strong & visible sport program</li>
    <p>
        Silverfin is reinventing the way financial advisors work, and Sunday reinvented the way a sporty workplace should work. Everyone at Silverfin gets the opportunity to play sports during working hours. But next to building a company gym, the participation rate at Silverfin had to be lifted.
        <br><br>
        We created Silverfin’s own branded sports collection to boost an active lifestyle within their company culture. The unique designs match perfectly with their brandlines on the one hand, and the sports program on the other hand.
        <br><br>
        Silverfin sent a strong signal to their people with the purchase of the 'branded' sports jerseys. Both during and after working hours they see the clothing appear. A strong community and extra visibility, that's a result that every company wants to achieve!

    <li>High performance sportswear for Delaware</li>
    <p>
        Delaware, one of the largest providers of digital services and consultancy in Belgium, wanted to boost the feeling of team spirit. If there’s one thing that drives Delawarians, it's that they share a passion for performance. We designed a collection of sportswear made available exclusively for the Delaware team.
        <br><br>
        We designed kits featuring the dashing Delaware-red. Because we’re working with sublimation, we were able to use the exact pantone colors from the Delaware brandbook. Our sportswear is made from the highest quality polyester and matches the best industry standards.
        <br><br>
        Delaware employees are through the roof with their awesome new sportswear. They feel proud to represent Delaware during their sports sessions and groups of colleagues are even meeting-up during the weekend to sport together!

    <li>Showpad’s global Sports Challenge</li>
    <p>
        Showpad is known for their revenue enablement software. Not only do they compete with the largest companies worldwide, their employees want to compete in sports challenges with the teams worldwide. They even have a sports committee that organises challenges and joins different sporting events. Yet all that was left to do was to transform the Showpadders into true sportive brand ambassadors.
        <br><br>
        Every employee that wanted to get sporty, could join the challenge and received some awesome sports socks. Which triggered a lot of hidden Usain Bolt’s to exercise their lungs out. Reaching the targets meant winning more personalized sportswear. We created full custom leggings, sports jerseys and cycling jerseys in the brightest colors and highest quality.
        <br><br>
        As many people were praising the initiative, the Showpadders that didn’t join the challenge were feeling a lot of FOMO. Even Showpad’s clients were hyped to claim one of the items of the sportswear collection. Challenge succeeded!
