                The distinction between an in-person and remote onboarding experience is a frequent topic of discussion. Remote onboarding requires more effort to make sure everyone is getting the same level of support. This blog will clarify more differences between traditional and remote onboarding today and how to and how to proceed with your remote onboarding program.

            It’s important to understand the difference between remote onboarding and onboarding. Since remote onboarding focuses on achieving exactly the same things as onboarding in-person: Introducing, integrating, acquainting, socializing. The difference, however, is in how you achieve those things, because the needs of new hires are not that different when they are onboarded virtually, versus in-person.

        <p>
            Traditional onboarding involves an employee coming into the office for training and orientation. This process usually takes place during the first few weeks of employment. During this period, the company provides the employee with the necessary tools and knowledge to perform his or her job duties.
            <br><br>
            Remote onboarding, on the other hand, occurs when an employee comes into the office for training, but then leaves after completing the training. After the initial training session, the employee works remotely from home. The main difference between traditional onboarding and remote onboarding is that employees who undergo traditional onboarding receive additional support throughout the entire onboarding process. 
            <br><br>
            For example, if an employee has questions regarding the new technology he or she is using, there is someone available to answer those questions. In addition, traditional onboarding allows companies to provide ongoing training to their employees.

        <p>
            If you start recreating the experiences of an onboarding at the office, you’ll neglect what’s really important: the impact of those experiences. For example, new hires will feel ignored while you regurgitate the same old presentation instead of feeling valued. Another thing to be aware of is that concentration spans are shorter online. And that socializing is more difficult, because fading into the background is easier. Or that ice-breaking conversations won’t happen naturally in the same way as in-person. 
            <br><br>
            The beauty of a completely remote setting is that onboarding can be as high-touch or low-touch as a new hire desires. Those who prefer visual learning can participate in a series of video calls and screen sharing sessions to go over every element of their onboarding issue. The newbies who prefer more self-study can take advantage of thorough documentation and readily available resources for self-study.

            Remote onboarding has many advantages over traditional onboarding. For example, it allows employees to work from home, which reduces costs and increases productivity. In addition, it helps reduce employee turnover because it gives them flexibility in their schedule. Finally, it allows companies to hire people who live outside of major cities. It allows employees to learn about new processes and systems without having to travel to the office. The benefits include saving time and money, while improving employee satisfaction.
            <br><br>
            Although going virtual brings new challenges, it also brings new opportunities. For example, the uniqueness of technology as a medium. A virtual experience also means capitalizing on the transformative power of technology to build new experiences. And that in turn leads to new pitfalls and challenges.
