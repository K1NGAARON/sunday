            After everyone was settled in at their home office, it quickly became apparent to many office-based teams that employees could be productive and focused when working remotely instead of at the office. Employers everywhere began to understand that remote work really works with the added benefit of an improved work-life balance. Yet for newly starting employees, there is a large gaping void that current employees do not feel. Especially if they are dispersed throughout different cities or countries.

            Onboarding is important, but remote onboarding is essential. It lays the groundwork for new hires to smoothly transition into their new role. The smoother the remote onboarding process is for the new employee, the greater the chances they will become an effective, long-term contributor to the company. A recent report by the leading HR organization Bamboo states that remote work can increase total-factor <span class="bold">productivity by 20% to 30%</span>, if there's intentional and thoughtful remote work set up or a kick-ass remote wellbeing program.

            Employees that have gone through an onboarding process show <span class="bold">18x more</span> commitment towards the company than employees that haven’t; Of all the employees that have gone through an onboarding process, <span class="bold">91%</span> says they feel <span class="bold">content</span> at work, while only <span class="bold">29%</span> of the employees that haven’t say they feel content; <span class="bold">89% of 'onboarded' employees</span> say they are well integrated into the company’s culture.

            7 reasons why it’s important to get this right
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since it’s not all about data, let’s go deeper on why investing time in developing an onboarding process will deliver those quick wins.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1) You need to make sure that your remote team knows where they stand. If they aren’t clear about what’s expected of them, then they won’t know whether they’re doing well or not. An onboarding process allows you to communicate those expectations clearly and consistently.
            </li>
            <li>
                2) When you hire new employees, you want them to be successful from day one. You want to know if they have the skills necessary to perform the job at hand and so you  must have a plan in place for training and development. This will help you avoid hiring bad employees.
            </li>
            <li>
                3) A well-thought out onboarding process shows that you care about your employees and their needs. Otherwise, they might feel overwhelmed and confused. And if they feel overwhelmed and confused, they might leave before they’ve had a chance to prove themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
                4) It makes it easier for your team members to communicate with each other. Remote onboarding is self-directed and lacks the in-person, live engagement that office workers have. Therefore, a thorough onboarding procedure is even more crucial for remote workers.
            </li>
            <li>
                5) It gives you a chance to build a good relationship between yourself and your team. The best onboarding programs include things you can do to ensure that your new hires feel welcomed and included. For example, you could send them a <a target="_blank" href="https://go.teamsunday.com/onboarding/">personalized onboarding box including company swag</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                6) An effective remote onboarding process will help you build trust with your team members and ensure that everyone has the same goals and expectations. Having clarity and good communication from the get-go creates an invaluable foundation for new hire success.
            </li>
            <li>
                7) Remote employees can quickly feel disconnected from their colleagues and the company as a whole, especially when they’re first starting out in a new role. Providing a clear program for the next period helps ensure your new remote employee can plan and prioritize their work.
            </li>

            Conclusion

        <p>
            The right onboarding makes your company more attractive to potential employees.
            <br>
            There are five reasons why having an effective (remote) onboarding process is so important for your company. First, it helps you attract top talent. Second, it makes your employees feel valued. Third, it ensures that new hires understand how things work at your organization. Fourth, it allows you to train your new hires quickly. And finally, it gives you a chance to see who your potential employees really are. 
            <br><br>
            So we can conclude that whether it may be in the office or at home, onboarding plays a critical role in a company’s  success and new hire's happiness. This innovative style of working (and living) is here to stay. Why? Along with many other benefits, working remotely can boost employee productivity and reduce turnover. However, you can only take advantage of these advantages if your remote workplace is effective.
