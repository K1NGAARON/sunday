                                The war for talent is huge. People value activities next to the actual job very highly. As a company, you have to stand out from all the rest.
                                <br>
                                Your current employees are your most important marketing tools. The way they speak about your company can make or break your image to the outside world. That is why building a strong connection between the company and its employees is so important.

                            Why is custom clothing the number 1 tool to boost employer branding

                                Building a strong connection between the company and its employees can be boosted with offline tools. Clothing is thé number 1 tool to do so. Why? Clothing is very personal. Literally nobody is wearing something that they do not support or stand behind.
                                <br>
                                Together with you, we make sure that your client receives the most awesome design, 100% on brand, combined with the best quality, sustainability and comfort. People proudly wearing your brand, even on Sunday, is the ultimate goal you want to achieve.

                                Companies receive the most fabulous rebrandings when cooperating with creative agencies. Only when it comes to customized clothing, these companies are left out in the dark and don't find the right supplier to deliver the newly branded clothing. 
                                <br>
                                Besides crappy quality, branding is not on point and mostly very standard. This results in a disappointing feeling and a not 100% successful branding project.
