            </h2>
            <p>
                From day one we decided to focus on quality and sustainability. At Sunday, we distinguish ourselves from other players in the market by making conscious choices regarding the quality of the fabrics and materials we work with. We are responsible for the entire design and production process, which allows us to constantly adjust and control the quality.
                <br><br>
                We also invest heavily in R&D of ecological materials. We want to be a sustainable partner for companies, and therefore consider it a must to keep looking for new techniques and materials that have a positive influence on our planet.
                <br><br>
                If customers have a question about a sustainable material for their product we are happy to think along with them and look for the most suitable solution.
                <br><br>
                Recently we created our first collection of recycled sportswear. The material is made out of recycled PET bottles. Transparency is crucial in this process, so every recycled sports jersey gets a clear hang tag stating which materials were used in its production. In addition, we were already using econyl, recycled fishing nets, as a material to make socks.

            </h2>
            <p>
                In 2019, we opened our own R&D and supply chain unit in the capital of the textile industry in Europe: Lodz. This allowed us to manage the entire manufacturing process and supply chain from A-to-Z. In 2020, 96% of the garments we produced were produced fully within the European Union. This has a number of advantages, the most important of which are:

            <ul style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <li>We can guarantee working conditions that match the European standards.</li>
                <li>We can carefully select suppliers we work with and hold them to the same standards.</li>
                <li>We contribute to the economic development of the European Union.</li>
                <li>We have shorter transport-chains, and thus lower CO2-emissions.</li>

                Transparency
                <br>
                Is Key
            </h2>
            <p>
                However, even though producing in the E.U. has a number of advantages, it isn’t always the best possible solution. In some specific cases we get requests from customers we can’t complete within our EU-based supply-chain. In those cases we sometimes need to source raw materials, semi-finished productsproduct or even finished products from countries like Turkey, North-Macedonia or China.
                <br><br>
                It’s a general misconception though to think that products made outside the E.U. can’t meet the same sustainability standards as those produced inside the Union. During the years, we have developed a rich database of trusted suppliers we’re confident to work with.
                <br><br>
                In those rare cases where a non-EU-production is necessary, we will always inform our customers about the process and the choices we’re making. Full transparency in combination with education of both our suppliers and our customers is our favorite way to move forward.

            <p>
                Sunday Wardrobe™ is our SaaS-solution, making it super easy for companies to warehouse, handle and ship clothing to key stakeholders.
                <br><br>
                Imagine the platform as your virtual wardrobe, consisting of different closets. Each closet is accessible to different departments and people of your organization. We fill the wardrobe with items from the collections we’ve designed, so the people with access to the different closets can build campaigns, using the items that are available in their respective closets.
                <br><br>
                Had a fair or an event where you used less fashion items than foreseen? That’s no issue, put the products back into your Virtual Wardrobe and use them in a different campaign. That way there’s no waste.
                <br><br>
                By the way, for every 50 packages sent, a tree is planted. In this way, we want to give something back to the planet.
