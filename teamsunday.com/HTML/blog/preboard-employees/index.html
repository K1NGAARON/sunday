            Preboarding helps employees feel welcomed and prepared for the day ahead. It also makes them more productive and less likely to leave early. Essentially, it is the very first step of the overall onboarding process. And yet a step that is overlooked by so many HR-managers and business owners.

        <h2>
            Give Them A Warm Welcome
        </h2>
        <p>
            Pre-boarding should reassure your new employee that though they may have been swimming in a sea of choice, choosing your company was the right one. 
            <br><br>
            It’s easy to forget how much an employee’s first impression matters. If they walk into a cold, dark, or dirty space, they might not feel as welcome as they would if they walked into a welcoming environment. 
            <br><br>
            Start communicating how excited you are for them to join, prepare them for success on day one and share your corporate culture from step one.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Set Expectations
        </h2>
        <p>
            You should also make sure your employees understand what to expect before they start working. This includes things like dress code, office layout, and any other policies or procedures that affect their job performance.
            <br><br>
            You might be surprised to learn that candidates want to know what is expected of them before they arrive at work on the first day. And while some want to know so they can wow you at the Monday morning meeting, the majority merely want to avoid looking foolish, going to the wrong office, or getting the dress code wrong.

        <h2>
            Create an Environment That Makes Them Feel Comfortable
        </h2>
        <p>
            A preboarding checklist should include things like making sure the office has been cleaned, having coffee available, and ensuring there are no outstanding issues with any equipment.
