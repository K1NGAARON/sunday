            Climate change and the lack of biological resources are creating a "storm." The numerous existing technologies that are prepared for wide-scale deployment contain a tremendous amount of potential power. Businesses have the power and capacity to overcome that storm by improving their way of doing business in a more sustainable way. One of the key industries is the textile industry.
            When you think about the textile industry, you think about fast fashion. Yet the textile industry is more than businesses with mass-produced clothing. Ethical companies have sustainable missions and values to promote humane clothing production facilities and to protect the environment.
            <br><br>
            Just as businesses, customers have started to attach great importance to where their items are made and sustainability has become ubiquitous in many people's thoughts. What about circular fashion? What are long-term solutions? What is the next step? Discover all the answers in our blog.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Fast Fashion Industry
        </h2>
        <p>
            To prevent pollution, people have been taking public transport and are consuming less meat, but did you know that the fashion industry is responsible for about 10% of CO2 emissions? Fast fashion is unethical and bad for the environment. Nevertheless, it is a significant sector that produces 100 billion pieces of apparel annually. It is said to be responsible for 2–8% of all global carbon emissions, according to the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion. Waste is the main problem. 
            <br><br>
            Consumers only wear clothing a few times before discarding it because fast fashion keeps up with ever-changing trends, resulting in the manufacture of low quality clothing that is not meant to last. Consumers would be less likely to squander or discard their clothing as rapidly if they started wearing high-quality apparel, like the clothing designed and made by Sunday.
            <br><br>
            Clothing items rarely get recycled and 80% of it ends up in the trash. Only 1% of worn clothes are recycled. The way we tackle sustainability challenges has evolved massively over the years. Today, we’re proud to say we have a made-to-measure approach in terms of sustainability and we’re able to match the exact needs and expectations all our clients have in terms of production with respect for People & Planet. As a result, production would decline, reducing the amount of greenhouse gasses discharged into the environment.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Sustainable Supply Chain
        </h2>
        <p>
            Fast fashion factory workers frequently receive wages that are below the minimum wage, which is unethical. Because the cost of making the garments is so low, employees frequently earn a fraction of that, which forces many of them to live in poverty. Major fast-fashion companies have been charged with producing inhumane working conditions for its employees in various situations around the world. At Sunday we partner up with others in the sector to create good infrastructure, and work on creating an enabling environment and market based approaches to make it possible for farmers to produce and sell cotton sustainably.
            <br>
            In 2019, we opened our own R&D and supply chain unit in the capital of the textile industry in Europe: Lodz. This allowed us to manage the entire manufacturing process and supply chain from A-to-Z. In 2020, 96% of the garments we produced were produced fully within the European Union. This has a number of advantages, the most important of which are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We can guarantee working conditions that match the European standards.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can carefully select suppliers we work with and hold them to the same standards.
            </li>
            <li>
                We contribute to the economic development of the European Union.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have shorter transport-chains, and thus lower CO2-emissions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            The Long-term Solution
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that the underutilization of garments and lack of recycling causes a loss of value of more than $500,000,000 per year. For instance, each person in Europe purchases 26 kg of clothing annually and discards 11 kg of it. Circularity can reduce the negative impacts of fashion in this situation. As well as making conscious choices regarding the quality of the fabrics and materials. We, at Sunday, are responsible for the entire design and production process, which allows us to constantly adjust and control the quality.
            <br><br>
            The circular fashion approach can be employed by the fashion industry to create goods that are made to reuse and made with secure, recyclable, or renewable materials. Processing pre-consumer materials in a structured way to save natural resources like soil and water. Long-term, this can help maintain the worth of the materials and generate both ecological and economic value.
            <br><br>
            At Sunday we also invest heavily in R&D of ecological materials. We want to be a sustainable partner for companies, and therefore consider it a must to keep looking for new techniques and materials that have a positive influence on our planet. Recently we created our first collection of recycled sportswear. The material is made out of recycled PET bottles. In addition, we were already using econyl, recycled fishing nets, as a material to make socks.

        <h2>
            Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to keep as much textiles out of the landfill as possible, it’s important for each of us to do our part. One of the ways to put that plan into action is through the 3 R’s of waste management.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Reduce means to cut back on the amount of trash we generate by our Technology investments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reuse means to find new ways to use things that otherwise would have been thrown out. For example the cushions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recycle means to turn something old and useless, like plastic bottles, into something new and useful like sportswear jerseys, felt bags,… .
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            Ethical Benefits of Sustainable Fashion
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In addition to minimizing resource use, circular fashion attempts to reduce waste by recycling pre-consumer material and turning it into useful items. The impact grows as only environmentally friendly materials, including cotton that is farmed under strict organic management, are used. Compared to traditional cotton crops, using organic cotton as virgin material alone saves an average of 91% water and 46% CO2.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recycled clothing isn't just good for the environment; it's also better for your body. It's been shown that wearing clothes made from recycled materials can help reduce the risk of certain diseases. For example, studies show that women who wear recycled clothing are less likely to develop breast cancer.
            </li>
            <li>
                They're Easy To Find. Many people think that buying recycled clothing is difficult because there aren't many places where they can buy them. This isn't true. In fact, there are many different kinds of recycled clothing stores. Some of these stores are large retailers with lots of locations. Others are small businesses that sell just one kind of recycled clothing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The impact of circular fashion will be increased in the future by making this technology available and developing a scalable solution for organic pre-consumer material in addition to recycling post-consumer material. Sustainable fashion is affordable. If you're looking for affordable, easy-to-find recycled clothing for your company, then you've come to the right place. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Continuous improvement
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the textiles sector, finding truly scalable solutions to social and environmental challenges can help improve the wages and working conditions of millions of people and help mitigate the negative impact on the environment. Moreover, sustainable practices are attractive from a business perspective, as resource efficiency, cost savings and a happy and well respected workforce often go hand in hand. 
            <br>
            We at Sunday believe that mainstreaming sustainability into key product design, development and purchasing practices is a critical step forward in promoting sustainable practices in the global apparel and cotton sector. The most important factor to be more durable is by optimizing the production processes. We don’t do this once per decade, no, we do this continuously! Continuous improvement is part of the Sunday DNA and forces us to do better.
            <br><br>
            Let’s have a chat and talk about that next (sustainable) step.
