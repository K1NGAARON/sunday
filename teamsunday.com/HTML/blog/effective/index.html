            Employee onboarding is not easy, but if you get the hang of it can be simple and above all it should be effective. Incorporating feedback cycles is one of the most important steps. If you follow a predefined process and adjust it continuously as you get more learnings and feedback out of your previous onboarding experiences, you quickly see return on your investments. For example reducing employee turnover.
            <br><br>
            Employee turnover is something that scale-ups and businesses and even nonprofits know should be kept to a minimum. Since your staff plays a crucial role in your everyday success, it’s crucial to invest the time in conducting a thorough search for the ideal applicant.
            <br><br>
            The best strategy to maintain low staff turnover and a good return on investment is to invest time in your employees. Because you're establishing expectations and fostering their sense of personal engagement in your company or organization, the first few weeks a new hire is employed are the most important.
            <br><br>
            You'll benefit if you do it correctly from the start. If you neglect the onboarding process, your new employee may leave or struggle, both of which would be disastrous if you were growing in large numbers.
            <br><br>
            So where to start? Here are four quick strategies for effectively integrating new hires!
        </p>

        <h2>
            Create a culture that works for you
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the biggest mistakes companies make when hiring new employees is not creating a welcoming environment. This includes making sure that new hires understand what's expected of them and how to fit into the team.
            <br><br>
            The first step in creating a great company culture is defining what you mean by work culture. The company's shared beliefs and goals form the workplace culture, policies, practices, and decision-making inside the organization are all part of the culture. Make your new employees immediately part of your culture, by giving your new hires an onboarding box. Branded swag is nearly the only solution to create a culture, yet it’s a great tool to create loyal ambassadors and to upgrade your onboarding process. It boosts the feeling of inclusion and makes the new hires immediately part of the team.

        <h2>
            Set expectations and goals
        </h2>
        <p>
            It's important to set expectations and goals at the beginning of the onboarding process. This will help new hires feel more comfortable with their role and responsibilities. 
            <br><br>
            By providing instructions and concrete tasks to your new hires right away, they will experience quick success and feel more motivated about their decision to join your team by setting a few manageable goals.
            <br><br>
            Make sure to direct them to the necessary resources and connect them with others who can assist them along the journey. A well-defined strategy creates a win-win situation for the business and the new hire.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Provide training
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the first steps in the onboarding process should be providing training. This will allow employees to learn how to use the company's software, hardware, and other tools.
            <br><br>
            It's crucial to offer continuous training all through the year. During these training sessions, the company's processes and tools are explained, and it also provides an opportunity for them to ask questions.
            <br><br>
            Your employees will gain better knowledge of the organization, its procedures, and its culture as a result. The likelihood of things going south from there is relatively low, but continue to give the new employee guidance and feedback during the first few months.
            <br><br>
            At Sunday we have a sales enablement manager, who is responsible for deploying programs and initiatives that enable our customer-facing teams to execute the core-aspects of their jobs more effectively, especially as it relates to selling and revenue performance. If the targets are reached, our employees are gifted with exclusive company fashion items.                       
        </p>

        <h2>
            Be human
        </h2>
        <p>
            When interviewing and introducing new team members to the larger team, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet have become almost the standard. This does not need you to completely stop engaging in face-to-face activities, though.
            <br><br>
            Making new hires feel welcome can be done by scheduling a lunch with a few staff members or meeting up for coffee before their first day. In their eyes and the eyes of the rest of your team, it also serves to remind them of the reasons they chose to work for you and to reaffirm your commitment to developing a welcoming and enjoyable workplace culture. 
            <br><br>
            At Sunday the first 60–90 days of a new hire's employment, we set aside just 15 minutes each week to keep them feeling connected and engaged. This keeps us informed of their accomplishments and alert to any difficulties or frustrations that may arise.
            <br><br>
            For example, a video conversation with employees and new hires can be a terrific way to greet them and introduce them to the team in remote working roles. But complement this with a welcome package containing helpful information and special touches or swag that are delivered in advance.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            When someone goes through your onboarding process, it is ultimately their first genuine look at how your business is managed and a chance for them to feel confident that they joined you at the correct time. This frequently contributes to how they see the company as a whole for weeks or years to come. 
            <br><br>
            To ensure that new hires start this new stage of their careers with an overwhelmingly positive mindset, it is important to take the time to treat each and every one of them as a valued team member right away. 
            <br><br>
            Your onboarding procedures are essential for positioning your staff and creating great culture. Upgrade your onboarding process with employee onboarding boxes to give them a fitting, warm welcome.
