            It's a long journey from the cotton field to the final product, and at every step of the complex supply chain we aim to ensure the highest level of responsibility. From experience we’ve learned how complex projects can get. So we’d like to offer our customers as much transparency and flexibility as possible in order to build a strong and successful partnership. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
            In this blog we will provide you with a summary and an estimation of time of what our collaboration will look like.

            Clothing is one of the most powerful tools of communication for any brand. So investing without clearly knowing what you want to get from it, isn’t the smartest move. Those objectives can vary largely from account to account. Some of our customers build company fashion campaigns because they want their staff to be more engaged with the brand, while others use the items from their collection for account based marketing actions, or to decrease their customer churn.
            <br><br>
            The first step is to listen to the current pain points and map out the project. If these figures lie within the line of your expectations and you agree on the timeline, we can start off the project. Moving forward, we love to hear what you have as an idea for your company fashion. Do you guys want a super unique collection with an all over print and flashy colors or did you have something more minimalistic with eye-catching detail in mind? No problem, our team will take your wishes into account.
            <br><br>
            In the timeline below you’ll see what you can expect from us, and what we will expect from you in terms of timing once the project gets started.

        <p>
            The design brief defines the core details including the goals, scope, and strategy. It needs to define what you, as a customer, wants from the designer. In many ways, it works like a roadmap or a blueprint, informing design decisions and guiding the overall workflow of your project, from conception to completion. 
            <br><br>
            We have developed a tool called the Sunday Design Canvas™. In the first phase of the design process, your account manager will get all the people involved around the table and use the Sunday Design Canvas™ to collect all relevant information.
        </p>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400" alt="">
        <p>
            Our account manager will ask a number of questions that will trigger discussions and ideas from everyone around the table. The result of this meeting will be a kick-ass briefing for our design team so together we’ll design a number of items that are both 100% on-brand and on-trend. With the help of your account manager and our fashion designers, you’ll decide which items and how many of them we’ll produce and store in the wardrobe.
            <br><br>
            Some of our customers start with one specific item and extend their collection from there, other customers have a new collection coming out every season (FW/SS) next to an essentials-collection with basics (think of plain white tees with a logo embroidered and business shirts) and a collection of premium sportswear. Anything is possible!
        </p>

        <h2>
            Collection (Sun)day™
        </h2>
        <p>
            After having received the briefing, our designers can work their magic. They collect ideals, make a trend-analysis and distill the key elements of the design brief. The result of their initial work will be presented on the so-called Collection (Sun)day™: an engaging and fun meeting where the first creative work from our designers is presented. The goal of the Collection (Sun)day™ is to inspire, nonetheless we don’t stop there. We dig deeper.
            <br><br>
            We’ll have you make a number of choices and we will design a few items from the collection on-the spot, allowing you to give real-time feedback. This ensures our designers get an excellent understanding of your views and preferences.

            Rendering a design on clothing is not that easy. There are many technical matters to be taken into account (materials, patterns, grading, fabrics, color dying & combinations, placement, sewing, ...). Our designers have all the expertise to know what can be done, without losing sight of current trends.
            <br><br>
            Once the final designs are finished, you’ll receive a quotation. At that point, it’s up to you to decide if you want to move forward with the project and start the production process (you accept the quotation).
            <br><br>
            Once we’ve received your approval on the designs, we’ll take care of things from there.

            As soon as the final designs are approved and the items that will go through to production are selected, we’ll leverage the efficiency of software to create all the required technical files in no time. These technical files contain all relevant information needed to ensure a smooth production process.
            <br><br>
            Before we produce all items of the collection in bulk, we start with one item. Our production experts will then examine this item studiously and send a photo of the item to your account manager, who will then present it to you. Some customers ask us to receive the samples produced physically so they can examine the quality first hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you’re into textile production, there’s no better place to be in the European Union than in Łódź, Poland. As soon as the designs for our customers are approved, our production team in Łódź jumps into action and makes sure everything gets arranged properly from a technical point of view. 
            <br><br>
            Because we manage the production of every item from cotton to end product, we are able to guarantee our customers that the highest possible standards in terms of quality and sustainability are met. Together with design, sustainability and quality are the elements we will never compromise on. Our experts are trained in dealing with these expectations and imposing them on every supplier or contractor we ever work with.
            <br><br>    
            The production process is intensive and involves a lot of manual labor. Therefore, one of the things we do not promise our customers is rapidity. Expect the production process to be anywhere between 8 and 12 weeks.
            <br><br>
            However, we promise to keep you posted in every stage of the process, and tell you everything about how your clothes are made. Full transparency is one of our trademarks!

            We took away the logistical struggles from our clients by working on a solution. 
            <br>
            The Sunday Wardrobe™ is our SaaS-solution, making it super easy for companies to warehouse, handle and ship clothing to key stakeholders.
            <br><br>
            Your wardrobe can consist of different closets, each of which featuring their own stock. Each of the closets are accessible to different departments and people within the organization. The structure of those closets in the wardrobe, often follows the general structure of the organization. Some of our customers choose to have closets for their different geographic locations (eg. EMEA closet, UKI closet, Northern America closet, …), others will implement the departmental structure of the company (eg. Marketing closet, Sales closet, HR closet, …).
        </p>
        <span>
            CTAAAAAAA
        </span>
        <p>
            By attributing different access-rights and stock to different people within the organization, you can enable team-members to launch campaigns from the Sunday Wardrobe™ in just a matter of minutes. This way, your HR-manager can set up a campaign for employee onboarding boxes, your SDR’s can start sending your prospect packages to increase their meetings-booked-ratio or you can have your marketing-team set-up awesome ABM-initiatives.
            <br><br>
            Before setting up the wardrobe, a workshop with all decision makers involved, will make the ideal structure crystal clear.

            So we’ve started at A and now we’ve come to Z. If we don’t know what’s right, we can’t do more of it. If we don’t know what’s wrong, we can’t do less of it. Without customer feedback, we are destined to fail. The world's leading CEOs agree: “Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.” 
            <br><br>
            Since we’re partners in this conquest, we want people to wear your brand. You want people to become real ambassadors. You want to make a better world for people and planet. We want the same thing. At Sunday, we choose to ask our NPS question monthly to keep a pulse on our customer happiness over time.

            <li>It identifies common patterns in happy/unhappy customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It’s our responsibility as a business to follow up with customers who share feedback. If we don’t, they won’t share feedback later on, and we run a higher risk of not capturing the good and bad feedback from our customers.
