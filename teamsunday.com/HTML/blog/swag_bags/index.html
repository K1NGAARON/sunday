            A gift bag or box known as a "swag bag" is stuffed with branded and personalized items. Employee motivation, volunteer appreciation, customer delight, and brand or product exposure are all achieved with swag bags.

            Here are a few tips to help you put together a swag bag that attendees will love and still be enthusiastic about even after the event:

            Keep your audience in mind before shortlisting products.
            <p>
                The ideal swag bag complements the event's theme and is stocked with items that recipients will be glad to own and want to display. This will make the recipient happy and provide positive brand impressions. Staying top of mind means your brand is associated with trust, this is what creates new opportunities.

            Reduce waste by choosing something that people use regularly.
            <p>
                You need to think about what kind of item you want to give away. Do you want something fun and interactive? Or would you prefer something more traditional? Think about what type of people will attend your event and what type of items they might enjoy.
                <br><br>
                The promotional goods industry is well known for offering massive paper catalogs with anything you can slap a logo on. Yet stop giving shapeless swag that ends up in the pile of pajama t-shirts, branded clothing is completely different from a USB-stick.           
            </p>
        </li>

            Look for a sustainable partner.
            <p>
                First things first, you need to make sure you have the right materials. If you're planning on giving away freebies at your event, you should consider using sustainable materials instead of polluting materials. 
                <br><br>
                Speaking of, don't compromise on quality and durability. Next to reusable water bottles, there are sustainable options for branded swag as well. Purchase your t-shirts or hoodies from businesses that ethically and sustainably source their goods. Quality made clothing will be worn and can be worn for a long time. And if you have any items left, use them in other promotional activities or at future events. So there’s no waste.

            Stay on-trend and on-brand.
            <p>
                Give away beautiful & wearable branded swag that seamlessly match your brand & culture. This makes it easier for attendees to identify with your brand.  Putting your logo onto quality merchandise isn’t always enough, check different creative possibilities that truly fit your brand. Remember: the swag bag has served its purpose as long as attendees remember where they got it from.

            Follow Up.
            <p>
                You need to follow up with your customers after the event. Send them a thank you email or text message within 24 hours of the event. This will help remind them that you care about their business and keep them engaged with your brand.
