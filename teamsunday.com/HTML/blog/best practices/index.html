                Best Practices for Onboarding New Employees
            </h1>
            <p>
                According to studies, new hire productivity increases with a smooth and engaging onboarding process, and 90% of employees decide whether or not to stay with a company within the first six months of employment. Why then do so many people get it so wrong?
                <br><br>
                We'll go over the top 5 employee onboarding practices that you may personalize to your group, sector, and applicants.

        <p>
            When a candidate accepts their first job offer, an onboarding process begins and it continues through any team transitions that may follow. An onboarding process helps new hires feel comfortable in their workplace and gives them a sense of belonging. One recurring theme is that onboarding ensures new workers are prepared for all that is thrown at them, from administrative to cultural learnings.

        <h2>
            Cultural Fit
        </h2>
        <p>
            Every company has its own specific DNA, mission, values,... . The combination of all these elements is referred to as the company culture. If that culture aligns with a person's attitudes, values, and beliefs, there’s a cultural fit.
            <br><br>
            Yet the idea that you're looking for a perfect alignment between the company culture and the culture of the employees is a prevalent misconception about cultural fit. It would be difficult to attempt this because every culture, both the corporate and staff cultures, is the product of countless years of organic growth, education, and trial and error.
            <br><br>
            It’s important to understand that with cultural fit: we’re not trying to change anything. We’re just trying to make the employee’s culture fit in with the company’s culture. We’re trying to find common ground as well as areas where both cultures can complement each-other.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Practice:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Implement company-culture training early in your onboarding-week.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Set Expectations
        </h2>
        <p>
            Before new employees begin work, set expectations with them. This will help them
            <br>
            understand what to expect when they arrive at work each day.
            <br><br>
            Very often, disappointment comes from failure to meet expectations. This starts with the job description you’re posting: it should be very clear about what you’re expecting from the employee and the employee should get a very clear idea about what he or she can expect from the company.
            <br><br>
            Just like the cultural fit, managing expectations works in both ways. What we’re really trying to achieve here is for the employee to know exactly what is expected of him or her in the new job, and for the company (and the colleagues) to know exactly what the new employee expects to get from his or her new job.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Practice:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Define what you’ll expect from the new colleague and what the new hire can expect from the company. Use the onboarding canvas to structure your conversation.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Create an Employee Handbook
        </h2>
        <p>
            Every organization has its own unique employee handbook. You cannot simply copy the employee handbook of another company and provide it to your staff. A good employee handbook outlines the specific policies and procedures that apply to your company. 
            <br><br>
            The book should be written in a style that reflects your values and the culture you have created, or aim to create, at your company. It should also include information about benefits, compensation, and leave policy. In order for your employees to have a good understanding of the working environment and workplace behavior expected.
            <br><br>
            Despite having the employee handbook to fall back on,  communication plays a key role here. It’s important for the employee to get a very clear view of the company. It’s equally important that the company - and colleagues of the new hire - get a clear view of the employee’s culture as well, sooner rather than later.
        </p>
    
        <h3>
            Practice:
        </h3>
        <p>
            There are plenty of ways to approach your employee handbook. Start with the foundation and values of your company and I, be sure to involve, next to management, your current employees in the process.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Provide Ongoing Training
        </h2>
        <p>
            One of the first steps in an employee handbook is training new hires. This includes
            <br>
            providing them with information about the company, its products, services, and culture. Training new hires helps them understand how to use the company’s systems and tools, and it gives them a chance to ask questions.
            <br><br>
            Note! It's important to provide ongoing training throughout the year. This will help new hires learn more about the company, its processes, and its culture.
            <br><br>
            The chances of things going south from there are very limited, but do keep investing in coaching and feedback throughout the first few months of the new employee.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Practice:
        </h3>
        <p>
            In your onboarding calendar (download template), it’s important to allow enough time for formal training. Use the experts you already have in your team to provide training.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Make the first day an experience
        </h2>
        <p>
            Give your new hires a fitting warm welcome, assign a buddy, surprise with company swag,…
            <br><br>
            It's crucial to make a good first impression. Make sure the initial day's or days' schedule is planned out in full advance. Giving the new hire a fantastic onboarding box is more than just a marketing trick; it immediately motivates and makes them feel welcome.
            <br><br>
            Use your employee on-boarding procedure to develop your employer brand if you don't already have one. Make your candidates feel welcome right away (or even earlier) and give them the freedom to tell others what an excellent company it is to work for.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Practice:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Upgrade your onboarding process with employee onboarding boxes to boost the feeling of inclusion and make the new hires immediately part of the team.
