            <p>

Participants at events anticipate that the organizers will take all reasonable measures to minimize the environmental impact of their conferences, workshops, and meetings. Visitors are reassured by sustainable events that your company prioritizes the greater good. But how can you plan one with ease and authenticity?

        <h2>
            Start with a Green Event Plan.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking to host a green event, start by creating a plan. This will ensure that you're doing everything possible to reduce waste and save energy. You'll need to consider how much food you'll serve, whether you'll use reusable cups or paper plates, and how you'll recycle materials. 
            <br><br>
            Additionally, transportation is crucial to making your event more sustainable. Just think about how much co2 emission could be avoided if everyone in attendance used more environmentally friendly transportation. Encouraging carpooling and ensuring access to public transportation by choosing a venue close to bus and train lines.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Choose Eco-Friendly Venues.
        </h2>
        <p>
            Start with the venue. It's easy to overlook the importance of choosing a sustainable location when planning an event. However, there are plenty of ways to make sure your next conference or meeting is as environmentally friendly as possible. First, choose a venue that has been certified. 
            <br><br>
            Second, find out if the facility offers any recycling options. Third, ask if the venue uses renewable energy sources such as solar panels. Fourth, check if the venue provides compost bins for attendees to use. Finally, ask if the venue has a recycling program for leftover food.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Go Paperless.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you're looking for a way to reduce waste at your next event, consider going paperless. With a sustainable event comes a sustainable way to take notes. Provide an app, where attendees can take notes, follow the day's program and find practical info! Printing documents and flyers that will end up in the trash or even worse on the ground. This will not only save trees, but it will also save money.
            <br><br>
            Look for sustainable partners, but select your partners with care. You need to make sure the organizations you’re working with are on the same page and thus work with sustainable or recycled materials.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Invest in sustainable merch.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you're planning on giving away freebies at your event, you should consider using sustainable materials instead of polluting materials. There are sustainable choices for branded swag in addition to refillable water bottles. 
            <br><br>
            Invest in t-shirts or hoodies from companies who source their products responsibly and ethically. Merch that is well-made will be worn and will last a long time. Use any leftover items, if any, in additional marketing campaigns or at upcoming events. There is thus no wastage.

        <h2>
            Be Creative with Food & Beverage.
        </h2>
        <p>
            The food for your event is a great opportunity to implement practical, environmentally responsible adjustments. Leaning toward plant-based meals is a fantastic place to start because the meat and dairy sectors are particularly problematic in terms of their impact on the environment (and, of course, on animals). 
            <br><br>
            Or make your next event more sustainable by using food and beverage options that are less wasteful. Consider serving local foods, such as produce grown locally or meats raised locally. Or, use reusable containers and utensils.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Think About Recycling.
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you’re planning a conference or other event, consider recycling. Not only will you be helping the environment, but you’ll also save money. Many cities offer free curbside pickup services for recyclables. You can also find out where you can recycle at your location.
            <br><br>
            The materials we use for an event can be changed in a variety of ways. One of the main causes of the enormous ocean pollution is plastic, which also leaves a significant carbon impact.To reduce the amount of plastic waste, utilize non-disposable items instead of plastic plates, forks, and spoons. Reuse and recycle as well! Pick reusable cutlery, wristbands, totes, and signs.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            Modern consumers expect companies to do their part for the climate. Everyone has a part to play in that regard, and consumers are increasingly demanding that organizations take responsibility as well. Don't wait for the government to impose regulations. Take the initiative yourself and make yourself already relevant to the consumer of tomorrow.
