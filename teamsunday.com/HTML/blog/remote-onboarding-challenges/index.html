                The Three Biggest Remote Onboarding Challenges
            </h1>
            <p>
                Creating a great onboarding experience isn't easy, so creating it remotely can even be called difficult. Like many other processes in remote teams, onboarding requires way more documentation compared how so many co-located teams operate

            Remote onboarding is mostly self-guided, the real-time face-to-face ability for new employees to ask questions does not exist. Knowing this, we've listed the three most common challenges created for onboarding employees working remotely.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Without a physical work environment which is critical in the traditional hiring process, you have to use video chats and fun team meetings to get the new team member to feel welcome.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first days or even the first weeks the new hire doesn’t get lost under the avalanche of new information. For example, screen sharing an hour-long welcome presentation and making email introductions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another challenge is building an emotional connection with a new team – when you aren't in the same space, it’s easy for a new employee to feel isolated especially if they work in another timezone.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            When you bring people on board, it’s your responsibility as a hiring manager to make sure they have everything they need to be successful in their role. If you’re not careful, a poor onboarding process can lead to a relationship with your remote team members that makes them feel disengaged and disconnected from the team. It’s now to give your onboarding program a boost!
