            Sustainability in the purchasing decision
        </h2>
        <p>
            To prevent pollution, people have been taking public transport and are consuming less meat, but did you know that the <span class="bold">fashion industry</span> is <span class="bold">responsible</span> for about <span class="bold">10% (!) of CO2 emissions?</span> Clothing items rarely get recycled and 80% of it ends up in the trash. Sustainability in the fashion industry can be controlled at any time. From production to the moment the consumer purchases the clothing, there are several factors that affect the environment badly.

            4 factors to create a sustainable image
        </h2>
        <p>
            Companies are gradually attempting to take advantage of a “sustainable image” by searching out greener alternatives. However, there are some things that organizations should think about as they make the transition to a more sustainable way of doing business. When it comes to sustainability, what <span class="bold">factors</span> do consumers now consider when picking a company?
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                The <span class="bold">price</span> of sustainable products must be in proportion to non-sustainable products. Consumers are willing to pay a little more for a sustainable item, but not if the price gap is too high. Consumers may find 5 euro shirts appealing, but they are unaware of the amount of water, energy and minimum wages.
                <br><br>
                When it comes to selling sustainable goods, companies must use the <span class="bold">true pricing</span> model. This is a tool for calculating a product's true cost. Assume a €5 T-shirt is sold in the shop, but this does not cover the entire cost of the item. This is due to the fact that the additional costs have not yet been charged. 
                <br><br>
                For example, 10 kg of CO2 was emitted in the processing of the product (€0.10/kg). Furthermore, 50 liters of water (€0.01/liter) were consumed, and one occupational accident (€0.50/accident) occurred on average for every 30,000 goods produced. When all these costs are taken into account, you know that the real price of the T-shirt is €7 instead of €5. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Credibility</span> is key! Consumers catch on very quickly when companies engage in <span class="bold">greenwashing</span>. This means that a company pretends to be more environmentally friendly or more socially responsible than it actually is. 
                <br><br>
                At Sunday, we want to neutralize our CO2 emissions as much as possible. We can say we make a difference ourselves. Hand-in-hand with Goforest, we make sure there’s a tree planted for every 50 shipments our customers make through the Sunday Wardrobe™. Amazing right?! In this way our consumers are also helping to make the world a little greener.
            </li>
            <li>
                Not only must the items be <span class="bold">long-lasting</span>, but they must also be of <span class="bold">high quality.</span> Despite the fact that sustainable sounds more appealing, quality is still the most important thing to consider when making a purchase. Low quality means high waste.
                <br><br>
                We, at Sunday, have full control over the manufacturing process. As a result, we can build one-of-a-kind, high-quality pieces. We use the best possible decoration methods on the garments so that the branded apparel will last for years. Clothing that hasn't been worn is simply waste. That is why we are dedicated to making high-quality, long-lasting apparel.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="bold">Consumer comfort</span> should not be compromised in the interest of sustainability. Consumers hate having to bend over backwards in order to be sustainable. When businesses sell environmentally friendly goods, they should be easily accessible.
                <br><br>
                This is taken into account by Sunday. Customers can switch between the original and recycled versions of items on the website. Customers can now purchase sustainably with a single click. Doesn't get any simpler than this, right?!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Sustainable entrepreneurship doesn’t have to be complicated at all. If you consider these four factors, you will soon have a greener image that customers love being a part of. 
            <br><br>
            Remember: be part of the solution, not the pollution!
