            How do you figure out what swag should be included in your onboarding box for new employees? A simple way to start creating this welcome packet is by asking yourself these simple questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do you want to convey your company culture to this new employee?</li>
            <li>What will this new hire need on a daily basis to do their job effectively?</li>
            <li>How will you make this new hire feel welcome and want to stay?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Although the requirements of each company vary, there are some general elements that should be taken into account for any welcome packet. These 5 items are a must-have and should serve as a reference guide for the employee onboarding process.
