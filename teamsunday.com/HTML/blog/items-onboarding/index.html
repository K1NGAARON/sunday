It's a great method to make new employees feel like they belong to the team as well as to increase the visibility of your company in front of more potential employees and customers.

            How do you figure out what swag should be included in your onboarding box for new employees? A simple way to start creating this welcome packet is by asking yourself these simple questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do you want to convey your company culture to this new employee?</li>
            <li>What will this new hire need on a daily basis to do their job effectively?</li>
            <li>How will you make this new hire feel welcome and want to stay?</li>
        </ul>
