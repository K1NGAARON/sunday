            Onboarding is a critical employee engagement process that defines, creates, & promotes culture. An effective onboarding plan will help employees feel comfortable with their new role and company culture. This includes providing training and support as needed. But what are the goals of remote onboarding?

            From an employee's perspective, an onboarding program is an opportunity to get used to a new environment. For an employer, it's a clearly pre-defined, thought-through and goal-oriented process, designed to achieve the following objectives:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Help the company leave a good first impression on the new employee;
            </li>
            <li>
                Help the new employee feel welcome and feel like a genuine part of the team from day 1;
            </li>
            <li>
                Help the new employee be successful in his job as soon as possible;
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase the retention rate of the company;
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase the general wellbeing of employees;
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Even though remote onboarding takes place virtually, the process has the same objectives as face-to-face onboarding. Since remote working employees don't have as many opportunities to organically integrate into the company processes and culture, good onboarding is even more essential. But unfortunately still overlooked by so many HR-managers and business owners.
