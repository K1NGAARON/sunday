                    Deliverect is a scale-up that connects UberEats, Deliveroo, Just Eat, Takeaway.com, and more delivery companies directly to restaurants by their POS system. Due to Covid-19, the explosive rise of online food delivery has forced restaurants to change how they operate. So Deliverect kept on growing, the company processed some $1 billion across 30 million orders for its customers. With 10 new hires every week, and so 10 new possible ambassadors, they were in need of a proper onboarding. Sunday created personalised onboarding boxes filled with fashionable wearables to send around the globe. Through the Sunday Wardrobe™ we made it super easy for Deliverect to warehouse, handle and ship the boxes. As we want to keep improving our platform, read how Deliverect’s case helped ensure new updates and automations.

                A Belgian startup called Deliverect offers the solution to food companies' nightmares: the mess of apps and hardware. They have built a platform to manage all of that through one seamless app.
                <br><br>
                As they are aiming for the moon, they know that their vibrant company culture plays a vital role in their success. What’s on the menu? Actively building a great internal culture through onboarding.

                Deliverect: connects third-party delivery platforms and food businesses around the globe.
            </h2>
            <p>
                A challenge Deliverect endured was onboarding. Due to Covid-19, the explosive rise of online food delivery has forced restaurants to change how they operate. So Deliverect kept on growing, the company processed about <span style="font-weight: 700;">$1 billion across 30 million orders</span> for its customers. That's up sixfold since their previous fashion collection for their first milestone. With business <span style="font-weight: 700;">growing</span> almost <span style="font-weight: 700;">750%</span> in the last year, Deliverect needed to expand their team and fast. As they want to create an authentic company culture, the first thing on their list was managing their employee onboarding kits.
            </p>
            <p class="client-quote">
                “No one is a number here; even if we will have 300 employees by 2021. Everyone's opinion counts, and things like team spirit and collaboration will always be high on our list of priorities"
                <br>

            <h2>
                Uniform onboarding boxes
            </h2>
            <p>
                Being able to reward customers with branded gifts gives them a feeling of importance. But by giving them an onboarding box filled with company fashion they made new employees immediately part of their culture. Deliverect was convinced they needed wearables for their second challenge.  A great onboarding package can tackle all these worries and create the perfect start for a solid onboarding process. As they are ambitious and innovative, they hire <span style="font-weight: 700;">10 new employees every week</span> and so <span style="font-weight: 700;">10 new possible ambassadors.</span> The Belgian company is a fast booming business, so building ambassadorship is a priority in their revenue generation plan.
                <br><br>
                And to make an onboarding process successful, it has to be uniform for everyone in the company. That’s why we created personalized boxes again, but now focussed on their onboarding process for their <span style="font-weight: 700;">11 different offices.</span> The box was filled with a hoodie, a T-shirt, socks and a thermos flask. This time, they wanted to <span style="font-weight: 700;">reduce the use of plastic,</span> so they chose a bottle made of metal instead of the dopper bottle made of plastic in the first box. Since they were over the moon with their last branded items, they wanted to continue the line in this collection by working with space references in the design.

            <h2>
                From Ghent to Sydney
            </h2>
            <p>
                Deliverect’s boxes needed to be sent around the globe. Because of their offices in Ghent, London, Madrid, New York, Paris, Dubai, Toronto, Edinburgh, Amersfoort, Sydney and recently an expansion with offices in Mexico, Uruguay and Kyrgyzstan they were in need of an international solution. Even though they help businesses manage their food delivery and takeout operations more efficiently, they are not a delivery provider.
                <br><br>
                That’s why they were immediately on board of our SaaS-platform <span style="font-weight: 700;">the Sunday Wardrobe™.</span> Through our platform we made it super easy for Deliverect to warehouse, handle and ship the boxes to their new hires all over the world. Not only did we take away the struggle of logistics and shippings, by grouping all the efforts related to clothing instead of having tonnes of shredded initiatives, <span style="font-weight: 700;">Deliverect saved up to 50% per year in costs.</span> Sending <span style="font-weight: 700;">more than 250 onboarding boxes</span> to specific addresses of their employees, means we were able to plant 6 trees in The Amazon rainforest.
