                Veerle graduated at The University of Ghent in Belgium in Germanic philology and a major in American Literature. While still at school, Veerle started writing local articles voor De Morgen and once graduated got the chance to cover fashion which she took with no hesitation. After almost 5 years she decided that she wanted to be on her own and started freelance writing for De Standaard focusing on fashion.
