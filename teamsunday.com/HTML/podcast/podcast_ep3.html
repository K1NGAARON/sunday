                Veerle graduated at The University of Ghent in Belgium in Germanic philology and a major in American Literature. While still at school, Veerle started writing local articles voor De Morgen and once graduated got the chance to cover fashion which she took with no hesitation. After almost 5 years she decided that she wanted to be on her own and started freelance writing for De Standaard focusing on fashion.

                Since her move, Veerle has become a fashion icon behind the scenes and hasnâ€™t looked back since. Always focused on her career, Veerle has interviewed thousands of fashion designers, written many books, taught at universities, and has traveled across the world accompanied by some of the biggest names in fashion.

                In this episode Veerle covers her inspiration and results of her first book, fashion in the metaverse, the clash and cooperation between street and couture brands and how these have changed the fashion community.
