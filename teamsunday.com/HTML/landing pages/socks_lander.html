                Did you know that we are regarded by many customers as the most sustainable partner? Not only because of the long-term relationship we want to build, but also because of the profound connection we feel to the sustainable goals of our customers' brands.
                <br><br>
                Our team of R&D experts can create products that meet the level of your expectations. From innovative new materials, to recycled yarns or uniquely designed production processes to reduce water consumption.
                <br><br>
                For example, for Too Good To Go, we developed socks made out of recycled fish-nets and designed a packaging-solution using zero plastics. That’s just one of the many examples of how we made company fashion with a positive impact on our planet.
