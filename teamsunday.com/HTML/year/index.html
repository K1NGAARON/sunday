                Time flies when you’re having fun. We can hardly believe one year has passed since we introduced our full rebranding.

            Last year we decided to rebrand Merchandise Essentials (founded in 2015)
        </h2>
        <p>
            The negative connotation attached to the term "merchandise" did not fit at all with the vision of the company. That combined with strong growth and a shift from product orientation to using company wear as a solution to business challenges, made us opt for a rebrand. Sunday was born!
            <br><br>
            Finding a new name was tricky though. Of course there’s the practical and legal issues to take into account, but above all, we wanted our new name to be short, catchy, positive and linked to our core activities.
            <br><br>
            So, we came up with Sunday: everyone’s favorite day of the week. Our vision has always been that we want to make clothing items people want to wear on a Sunday, so the link with what we do is there as well.

            Our first year as Sunday was filled with a lot of “firsts” and “new beginnings”, even though the company already exists since 2015. 
            <br>
            New beginnings for a lot of new colleagues, a new office in the UK and the start of the construction of our new HQ. 
            <br><br>
            The first Sunday collections were designed and are proudly worn by all colleagues. There was even a first recycled sportswear collection!
            <br><br>
            Actually, we did too much to list everything up. Want to know more about Sunday? Feel free to reach out! We are also present at a lot of fairs (check out our LinkedIn to see where we will be present).
